# Acidic Bosses

A work in progress Terraria mod which aims to rework the Terraria bosses to be more difficult and unique while staying *mostly* true to the style of Terraria.

This is currently on hold as I am having a lot of difficulty figuring out what to do for the Eater of Worlds and the Queen Bee.
