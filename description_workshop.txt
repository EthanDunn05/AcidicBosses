[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Acidic Boss Reworks takes a unique spin on bosses with an emphasis on learnability and attack telegraphing.
Multiplayer is supported because Terraria is more fun with friends!

As this is an alpha release the bosses are not fully balanced yet.

[h1]Visual Style[/h1]
This mod adheres to the style of the vanilla game while trying to be more visually interesting without going overboard on shaders.
The goal of the visuals is to bring bosses up to a modern standard without feeling overly "modded".

[h1]Supported Bosses[/h1]
[list]
    [*]King Slime
    [*]Eye of Cthulhu
    [*]Eater of Worlds
    [*]Brain of Cthulhu
    [*]Queen Bee
    [*]Skeletron
    [*]Wall of Flesh
    [*]Twins
[/list]

[h1]Boss Roadmap[/h1]
These plans are in no particular order.

[list]
    [*]I want to rework Queen Slime soon. She will likely recieve some pretty huge changes because I don't really like her fight at all.
