[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Acidic Boss Reworks takes a unique spin on bosses with an emphasis on learnability and attack telegraphing.
Multiplayer is supported because Terraria is more fun with friends!

As this is an alpha release the bosses are not fully balanced yet.

[h1]Visual Style[/h1]
This mod adheres to the style of the vanilla game while trying to be more visually interesting without going overboard on shaders.
The goal of the visuals is to bring bosses up to a modern standard without feeling overly "modded".

[h1]How to activate[/h1]
You need to create a new world in order for bosses to play with this mod's reworks.
An icon will appear on worlds which have the reworks active on the world select screen.

[h1]Supported Bosses[/h1]
Currently most bosses in pre-hardmode are reworked with the exception of Queen Bee and Deerclops. This means that the mod currently reworks the following bosses:
[list]
    [*]King Slime
    [*]Eye of Cthulhu
    [*]Eater of Worlds
    [*]Brain of Cthulhu
    [*]Skeletron
    [*]Wall of Flesh
[/list]

[h1]Boss Roadmap[/h1]
These plans are in no particular order.

[list]
    [*]I plan to release the Queen Bee when I get some inspiration for the boss fight. As it stands my brain is empty when it comes to that boss.
    [*]I want to rework Queen Slime soon as well. She will likely recieve some pretty huge changes because I don't really like her fight at all.
    [*]I also plan to work on the Mechanical bosses and release all three of them together in one update.
[/list]
